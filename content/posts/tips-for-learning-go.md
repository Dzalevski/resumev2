## 1. The Little Go Book
[The Little Go Book](https://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/) is old, but it's a very good start and It's aimed at developers who might not be quite comfortable with the idea of pointers and static typing. 

## 2. Don't skip the fundamentals
Go has a very readable [language spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec) that was clearly written to be read and understood, even if you don't have a master's in language or compiler theory. 
Reading language spec document alongside [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html), another great resource from the Golang creators, will give you a huge boost in readiness to use the language effectively and properly.

## 3. Use good language tools

Go have a very strict typing rule so everybody's code will be the same.
You will quickly learn about go fmt and the power of it.

`gofmt` is built into the language runtime, and it formats Go code according to a set of stable, well-understood language rules.

I strongly recommend using an editor or IDE with good Golang support features.
I prefer [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/promo/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI06CSiJid7AIVSPiyCh3K3QJrEAAYASAAEgLEufD_BwE) but since is not free [Code Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) have very good plugins for Go too.

## 4. Start typing some code

- I strongly recommend to start typing and learn about go concepts from  [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/) hands-on introduction to Go using annotated example programs.
- [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)

## 5. Simple RESTful API

For last you can make simple RESTful API using go and one of supported database plugins, I recommend `mysql` for start.
