Hello there! I’m a software engineer in Skopje, Macedonia with a passion for computers, programming and designing and developing distributed systems. I have 3 years of experience as a backend engineer with a focus on distributed systems, designing APIs and microservices.

Currently I’m working at [InPlayer](https://inplayer.com/) as Backend engineer

In my free time, I love working on open-source software, programming in Go as well as dabbling with the latest tools and technologies, and testing new stuff out on my pet projects. I am also a competitive gamer.
